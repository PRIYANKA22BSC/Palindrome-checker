## Overview

The Palindrome Checker is a simple tool that allows users to check whether a given word, phrase, or sequence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring case, spaces, and punctuation.

## Features

- Palindrome Validation: Checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome.
- Case and Punctuation Insensitive: Ignores case, spaces, and punctuation in the check.
- Simple Interface: User-friendly interface to input words or phrases.

# How It Works

# Palindrome Checking Logic:

- Strips away all non-alphanumeric characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).
- Converts the string to lowercase.
- Compares the cleaned string with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.
